### Model Answers:

1. How can econometricians diversify their toolset with ML Methods?

"In this review, we want to make the case that economists and econometricians also (...) 'need to move away from exlusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.' We discuss some of the specific tools that empirical researchers should benefit from" (p. 686).

2. Strengths & weaknesses:

2.1. Strengths

- Makes an exhaustive list of current (at the time of writing the article) ML methods relevant to econometrics

- Explains the application of each method to different goals and settings for econometrics

2.2. Weaknesses

- Does not do a deep dive into the nuances of each method and how they can be modified for different econometric goals and data settings

- Lacks illustrative examples for the listed methods.

3. Exhaustively lists ML methods that economists and econometricians should be aware for a variety of settings.

4. For each of the listed methods and their corresponding applications, a deeper dive into the nuances, like data requirements, assymptotic characteristics of the estimators, tuning of algorithms in response to specific settings, etc, would be very useful resources. Another useful addition would be more illustrative examples for the use of the different methods.
