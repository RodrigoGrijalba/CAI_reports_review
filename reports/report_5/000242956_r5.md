# Report 5: Orchestrating Data_ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro [Link](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/CausalAI-Course/blob/main/reports/report_5/Orchestrating%20Data_ML%20Workflows%20at%20Scale%20With%20Netflix%20Maestro%20_%20by%20Netflix%20Technology%20Blog%20_%20Netflix%20TechBlog.pdf)

The article showcases the power of Meastro, the new workflow platform of Netflix. Contrary  to Meson, the previous platform, Maestro is not based on a signle leader architecture. This means they can horizontally scale the system rather that scaling vertically. This allows them to keep up with tasks demands specially on peak traffic hours. Throughout the article, the author explains multiple challenges they encounter when developing a new platform, such as scalability, usability, among others. 

For example, not only are the size of workflows big, but also the Orchestrator was commited to ensuring that the delay introduced by its scheduler component remained below 1 minute, which is particularly hard during high peak hours. As for usability, different users such as engineers, non-engeneers and even content producers, we'll have different needs and the platform needs to be user-friendly for all of them. Sometimes these needs require the platform to have different features, even contradicting ones, so it can't be optimally tailored to one specific type of user.   
  
The article does an incredible job by showing the reader the advantages of Maestro using images and diagrams, as well as showing the structure of Maestro as a DAG. These figures allows the reader to see how advantegeous horizonal scaling can be. Unlike the previous Orchestrator, Maestro stablishes a workflow DAG limit size as well as providing a foreach pattern. This aids the users decompose a big workflow into smaller more manageable workflows, as well as running certain part of a DAG multiple times with different parameters. Another great set of pictures are the ones to explain conditional branching, sub-workflows and output parameters. 

One potential weakness of the article is the high level of entry to truly understand the power of Maestro. Although pictures and diagrams help the reader, non-tech people will still have issues knowing many of the terms used such as single leader architecture, SLO, or CRDB. Some kind of footnote or dictionary would've been helpful for readers not familiar with such terms. A second weakness is the article barely provides examples of how users of Maestro make use of the platform's advantages. For instance, to explain how signal service provides signal lineage, the author uses the example of a table that is updated by a worflow and how it is allow to impact other workflows. Similar examples for more Maestro features would've added value to the article. 

Finally, this article advances knowledge by showcasing how Netflix takes big data orchestration to the next level, as well as explaining the new challenges faced and how to better platforms to overcome them. Some next steps to take would be to explore new features that can be implemented to further aid users needs, as well as gathering more empirical data to have solid evidence on how Maestro has improved efficiency for Netflix.
