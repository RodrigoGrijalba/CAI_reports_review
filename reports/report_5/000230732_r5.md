## Orchestrating Data/ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro 

The article focuses on the development and implementation of Maestro, a next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform at Netflix. Various aspects of Maestro are discussed, including its architecture, scalability, usability, and features. The primary focus appears to be on addressing the challenges of orchestrating large-scale data workflows efficiently and effectively, ensuring scalability, reliability, security, and ease of use.

One of the strengths of the article is that it provides concrete solutions, such as the development of Maestro, a workflow orchestration platform designed to address challenges of both scalability and usability. Additionally, a positive aspect is that the authors explain Maestro in a didactic way using Directed Acyclic Graphs. One drawback of the article is the use of somewhat uncommon terms for readers who are new to these topics, making it challenging to understand. Additionally, it would have been interesting if it provided more information on how the transition to Maestro can be beneficial for Netflix or, overall, for users.

This paper advances knowledge about orchestrating large-scale data and machine learning workflows, particularly in the context of Netflix, by presenting Maestro as a next-generation workflow orchestrator designed to address scalability and usability challenges. Its contribution lies in providing a comprehensive overview and practical insights into the development and implementation of Maestro, which can serve as a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers in the field of data engineering and workflow orchestration.

A valuable next step to advance this question would be to conduct case studies or interviews with users who have implemented Maestro in their workflows. This would provide practical insights into the real impact and effectiveness of Maestro. Additionally, further research could focus on quantitatively measuring the performance improvements achieved by organizations that have adopted Maestro compared to those using other workflow orchestration solutions. This would help provide empirical evidence of the benefits of using Maestro and further validate its effectiveness in managing large-scale data and machine learning workflows.
