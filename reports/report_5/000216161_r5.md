The need for an orchestrator for data workflows is one of the most important aspects for experimentation at a large scale with data science. This is due to the enormous amounts of online experiments and different ways that it could be done, it is necessary to scale upwards the orchestrator to allow for workflows to keep up with the demands of the tech giants. The current goal is to create a horizontal orchestra that can work in clusters to achieve greater scalability. 

However, the are problems with the implementation of an orchestrator that need to be solved for example, usability in which we must make the orchestrator as easy to use and abstracted as possible, however, features will need implementation and careful consideration due to problems that could arise from opposite features and too many features being placed into the orchestrator. Second of all, the number of jobs can be rather enormous and this could create bottlenecks or hotspots in the orchestrator that could slow down the processes and clusters. 

The proposed solution to these problems is Maestro, where the main unit of work is through jobs and steps that are isolated through a workflow. It also allows for a variety of features that help the developers expand their workflows to other areas and have more customization and flexibility with their workflows. 

Scheduling is one of the main points of the paper, where it is the main job of the orchestrator to not only execute workflows at the right time but also provide the right timeframe and event-based ways to create more efficient ways to execute said workflows. Thus here comes the signal service, which serves for that exact purpose which is to collect data without running the workflow and then running the workflow when the right parameters are in place.

Another of its main features is the division of steps through larger DAG and workflows that can then be used and nested into smaller ones so that a single workflow can be large but then it can have smaller workflows for specific work without creating an enormous DAG that can not be viewed in entirety in the UI. This is a good approach to creating better code and workflows by forcing some organization into the coding.

Finally, there are various ways in which the introduction to interface, abstraction, and usability are introduced. The approach of the report remains within good bounds to be an introduction to workflow, however, it must rely more on specific examples that can be used to specify processes and workflows, how these workflows need to be placed, and give examples of how and why these must be implemented. 

A good approach to continue on with the paper would be to give it a main example or logic to why a company or development team would use an orchestrated workflow.
