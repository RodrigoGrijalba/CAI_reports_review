⮚ What is the research question of the article?
How good is Maestro as an advanced platform for data workflow orchestration and machine learning? 
⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
Strenghts:
Scalability, Maestro is capable of handling a lot of information every day, while maintaining strict service level objectives (SLOs) of less than one minute of scheduler-entered delay, even during traffic spikes; and usability. 
Weaknesses: management and implementation costs
⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
(If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided
publish the article).
Maestro offers as I mentioned before scalability and usability are strengths for Maestro. Also, Maestro integrates security and identity management mechanisms to ensure that jobs are executed while maintaining compliance and security, managing permissions and access within the Netflix data ecosystem, ensuring efficient and secure workflows in compliance with the company's privacy and security policies.
⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
The next step would be to include end-user reviews of the platform's usability testing, this data would be interesting.
