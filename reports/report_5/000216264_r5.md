# Workflow orchestration challenges: The use of Maestro in Netflix

The paper proposes to explore what scalability and usability challenges are faced in orchestrating data workflows at a massive scale. For example, Netflix requires a workflow that handles hundreds of thousands of workflows and millions of jobs per day, so they needed to upgrade the workflow they were using, which only schedules about 70,000 workflows and half a million daily tasks. In particular, the authors focus on the latest workflow orchestrator, Maestro, which can scale horizontally to manage workflows across clusters of servers running uninterrupted.

There are several strengths to how the authors describe Maestro in detail. First, they highlight its ability to support multiple use cases and improve usability for end users. Second, they explain Maestro's architecture in an illustrative way that makes it easy to understand the workflow's steps at different stages. Third, they provide an example of the YAML DSL code of a workflow at a specific date range to illustrate how changes are made in the workflow. Perhaps a weakness of the article would be the constant use of terminology used only in the workflow orchestration. For a new reader, it would not be fluent to have to look up the meaning of some terms before continuing reading.

For people interested in working in data-driven companies, the article would be one of the very few that describe the actual problems that exist within such companies. It explains, in a single text, the problems that can arise from having to work with large lines of code. In addition, they tell you about the solutions that using Maestro provides for various users such as data scientists, engineers, and content producers for different use cases.

A couple of valuable steps to move forward on the authoring issue would be to 1) further develop the templates and the creation of sub-flows so that workers can more easily use them in their teams and for all employees. This will make it faster to set up workflows. And 2) continue to work on master development to make it more user-friendly.
