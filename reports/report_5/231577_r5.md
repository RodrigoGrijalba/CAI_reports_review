# Orchestrating Data/ML Workflows at Scale With Netflix Maestro

The authors frame the article around the challenge of orchestrating and managing large-scale data and machine learning workflows efficiently and scalably, as previous models faltered during peak hours and lost efficiency when scaling the system. The focus specifically falls on Netflix's newly developed model, Maestro, which has addressed these scalability and usability challenges amid the exponential growth in demand and complexity of workflows.

Maestro's primary strength lies in its ability to scale horizontally, allowing it to handle hundreds of thousands of workflows daily with minimal delay. This is possible because users can define schedules using templates or utilize signal triggering, which prevents unnecessary system resource expenditure by checking if the workflow is ready to execute, replacing it with conditions that trigger execution.

Another strength is usability; Maestro allows users of varying skill levels to manage or modify workflows. This is achieved through abstractions that let the user choose their "step" and configure its parameters. From graphical user interfaces to specific domain languages like YAML, Python, and Java, end-users can select the method that best suits their needs, simplifying the creation and management of complex workflows.

However, managing extremely large workflows remains a challenge, as the user interface and system capabilities may be insufficient to efficiently handle workflows with millions of nodes. This limitation not only affects the system's effectiveness but can also lead to increased time needed to diagnose and resolve issues within the flow, ultimately impacting the efficiency of the model.

Maestro's main contribution lies in conceptualizing the workflow as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). This allows workflows to be composed of various steps or tasks, each representing a unit of work that can be executed in a specific sequence. Moreover, these steps feature properties that extend their possibilities, such as dependencies that allow a step to depend on the completion of another, triggers that can activate events or steps, and the ability to include foreach or conditional branching, as well as the capacity to contain their own parameters and configurations.

Finally, a step forward in the processes of large-scale workflow management is the integration of AI capabilities, training them with historical workflows to identify repetitive functions or steps that optimize the flow to save resources and improve efficiency. Also, using them in the development of debugging tools that allow non-advanced users to monitor or diagnose problems within their workflows early on.
