## Nicholas Larsen, Jonathan Stallrich, Srijan Sengupta, Alex Deng, Ron Kohavi, and Nathaniel T. Stevens, published, 2023

### What is the research question of the article?
The research question of the article is to provide an extensive review of the A/B testing methodology in the context of online controlled experiments, while also highlighting the statistical challenges and best practices associated with conducting such experiments. The paper seeks to answer how online experiments can be designed and analyzed effectively, including considerations such as proper metrics, sample size determination, bias mitigation, and multiple testing issues, to draw valid conclusions from A/B tests.

### What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
### Strengths:
Comprehensive Examination of A/B Testing: The paper thoroughly reviews various aspects of A/B testing, such as designing controlled experiments, choosing appropriate metrics, and addressing multiple testing problems.
Practical Guidance: The authors provide actionable recommendations for practitioners in the field of online experiments, offering guidelines on how to effectively design and conduct A/B tests.
Identifying Pitfalls: The paper identifies common statistical challenges in online experiments, such as selection bias and improper metric choice, and proposes strategies for addressing them.

### Weaknesses:
Limited Depth in Advanced Techniques: Although the paper discusses common statistical challenges, it may lack in-depth coverage of advanced statistical methods, such as hierarchical models or causal inference approaches, which could offer additional insights in complex experimental designs.
Online Experiment Focus: The focus on online controlled experiments may limit the paper's relevance for practitioners working in non-online experimental contexts, where different challenges and solutions may apply.

### How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
The paper advances knowledge in several ways:
Insightful Overview of A/B Testing: The review provides a clear and structured overview of A/B testing methodology, helping practitioners understand key concepts and challenges in designing and analyzing online experiments.
Highlighting Challenges and Solutions: The paper identifies common issues such as bias, variance, and multiple comparisons, and proposes practical solutions, which can guide practitioners toward more reliable and valid A/B testing practices.
Best Practice Recommendations: By offering recommendations on experimental design and analysis, the paper provides a set of best practices that can enhance the quality and rigor of online controlled experiments.

### What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
Exploring Advanced Statistical Techniques: Future research could delve into more sophisticated statistical techniques, such as causal inference methods or machine learning approaches, to enhance the precision and reliability of A/B testing and offer more nuanced analyses of complex experimental data.
Interdisciplinary Applications: Extending the research to interdisciplinary applications across various industries and sectors can validate the best practices and recommendations provided, ensuring their robustness and generalizability across different contexts beyond the online environment.
By exploring these next steps, researchers and practitioners can continue to improve the methodology and application of A/B testing in online controlled experiments, leading to more robust and reliable results.
