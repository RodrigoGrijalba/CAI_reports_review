Online controlled experiments (OCEs),


Online controlled experimentation or OCEs provide a way to increase sales for large companies, these type of companies rely on digital services and are generally used by large scale digital companies like amazon, google, apple and netflix. These companies introduce a culture of experimentation to lead in data driven decisions and test a variety of experiments to increase profits even though most of these ideas may not be profitable. Its main advantages are the large sample size, low cost and simultaneous experimentation possibilities. 

The core of the methodology is to optimize a single variable, when it is a mean we wish to optimize by finding the average treatment effect, which we can do so thanks to the Central limit theorem and enormous sample sizes. We may find reproducibility problems with the experiment where only a fraction of the userbase is used.

One of the major problems we find is that we must find contend with the experimentation power issues. The subset of these problems is that experiments either impact all of the population with the magnitude of the change is small, the experimentation does not affect all users attenuating the experiment and third that the treatment is on subpopulation of interest reducing power even further. Thus we must seek to boost sensitivity through reduction of Y variance or reducing variance of the estimators. 

One way to boost sensitivity is through CUPED which uses previous data to estimate an augmented estimator of mean zero through. Another way is through Triggered Analysis, which means selecting the subset of the population that would have interacted with the experiment thus reducing variance and increasing sensitivity. 

Heterogeneous treatment effect may also be used for identifying the effects on different sub-segments of the population, for this method it is trying to find CATE or the conditional treatment effect. We can also find problems when trying to estimate the long term effects of the treatment due to the fact that there may be biases in short-term effect. There are many methods however these are highly specific, one which shows promise is the short-term metrics that are correlated with long-term effects. 

Another important part of the OCE is that we want to conduct experiments that canâ€™t harm the user experience and profits for the company, the only way to do this is through experiments that can be stopped as soon as they prove to be harmful to the metric we wish to optimize. 

Also, there may be interference between treatments, where the outcome may change due to the treatment of other users within the experiment.
In conclusion, OCEs require a variety of methodologies to make sure that the regressions are unbiased, without interference and we must deal with the lower power of the experiments.
