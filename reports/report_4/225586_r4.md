⮚ What is the research question of the article?
The paper seeks to share the applications of controlled experiments in business contexts with statisticians, giving a clear motivation and explanation of the importance of these techniques in online environments as they called online controlled experiments and a reviewing the challenges of these methodologies.
⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
The paper explains and reviews  almost all the basic concepts used in impact evaluation, concepts like SUTVA, The model of expected results or “Rubin Model”, Stratified sampling, Minimum detectable effect and power calculations, that could give a known background to be familiar with.
A possible weakness is that the paper only consolidate existing knowledge and introduce hardly any or not any new concept, and did not use empirical data that could be a good way to enhance real-world applicability. The paper don’t have concrete guidelines for practitioners .
⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
The contribution of the paper is the sharing of a barely novel sector of appliance for the impact evaluation techniques  giving statisticians or economists a new possibility of research or even work opportunities for those ones not interested only in the academy sector
⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
A superb next step is to test this on the field and share this to the academic community with the rigor of the academics and not only with the business sector, and a novel well known guideline for those who want to entry in this sector.
