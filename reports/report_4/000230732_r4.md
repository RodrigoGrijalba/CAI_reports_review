## Statistical Challenges in Online Controlled Experiments: A Review of A/B Testing Methodology (Larsen N., Stallrich J., Sengupta S., Deng A., Kohavi R., & Stevens N. (2023)

The article highlights the importance of online controlled experimentation (OCEs) in companies that have a significant impact on a broad user base. As various social functions move to the digital environment, OCEs find applications beyond technology and e-commerce, such as in the optimization of political advertisements.

The document's approach to online controlled experimentation (OCEs) stands out for its comprehensive coverage of a wide range of relevant topics, ranging from strategies to improve sensitivity to variable control and stratified sampling. The use of compelling examples is another strong point, as it helps illustrate the practical applicability of the discussed concepts, making them easier for readers to understand. Additionally, I found it interesting that the misconception that OCEs are not subject to inadequate samples was addressed.

It's also interesting to note that treatment assignments can influence the outcomes of other participants in the experiment, thus violating the SUTVA assumption. This interference can occur through direct connections between users or competition for shared resources in two- or three-sided markets. Recent literature has addressed how to tackle this issue using methods such as cluster-based randomization and differences-in-differences analysis.

One potential drweaknesses awback of the paper could be that it primarily focuses on reviewing the methodology of A/B testing, without delving deeply into other approaches or techniques of online experimentation that are also relevant in the field.

A valuable next step to advance this question would be to conduct empirical studies or simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different interference mitigation strategies in real-world online experimentation environments.
