## Rapidly growth of A/B testing solutions for unbiased ATE estimation

This review aims to answer what are the best statistical methodologies to run online controlled experiments (OCEs) at scale. This question arises from the growing application of A/B testing methodology in large companies such as Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Netflix, to name a few. Since their main objective is to make data-driven decisions to increase the number of customers and reduce costs, the solutions available to find the ATE have been on the rise, even creating a gap in the statistical knowledge of academia. Among the main solutions, the authors mention: improving experimental power, estimating heterogenous and long-term treatment effects, choosing when to stop the treatments, and adapting sequential testing methods in OCEs.

To answer this question, the authors do a great job of first introducing us to the problem (by mentioning motivating examples) and then explaining the most appropriate solutions. However, the analysis does not end there, as the authors also mention the sub-problems that can generate one or the other way in the estimation of an unbiased effect. For example, companies wishing to test a new feature may run the risk of losing customers in the treatment group (in the presence of a bad feature). In that case, one solution is to decide to stop the OCE when they obtain a "maximum" p-value that confirms the treatment effect. However, the authors mention that such a solution could come with other problems, like having more false positives. Therefore, there is a trade-off between having the Type I error or losing clients.

If I may offer some suggestions, it would be better to avoid providing excessively detailed information about the problems that arise from implementing each solution. This information can be overwhelming for academic readers who are interested in learning about a specific problem. Instead of covering several issues in one review, it might be more helpful to focus on the five major problems mentioned and write separate reviews for each one and even address those papers they suggested as further readings.

Nevertheless, I consider that they managed to close the gap between the implementation of ML techniques to do correct A/B testing in large companies and what has been found so far in the academic world. This review has served as a bridge between the algorithms used in companies (which are usually private) and the people who wish to learn about the subject, also creating a greater desire to continue promoting open source.

As a result, it would be good to increase interest in identifying other problems with A/B testing or its variations (such as A/B/n testing). For example, researching the problems and solutions by applying different treatments at once could help find effects much faster and even with fewer resources. In addition, as the authors mention, the application of OCEs also happens in other areas outside companies (such as to measure important social facets). I believe that showing the problems of this type of experiment could also contribute to accelerating the creation of unbiased estimators and thus also explain the behavior of people to solve social problems.
