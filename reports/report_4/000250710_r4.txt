The surge of online businesses in the late 1990s opened a new frontier for data-driven decision making through online controlled experiments (OCEs), 
with A/B testing being a prominent tool. The paper "Statistical Challenges in Online Controlled Experiments" delves into the complexities of conducting 
these experiments, offering a comprehensive review of the statistical methodologies and challenges unique to this domain.

The paper's strength lies in its thorough analysis of inherent statistical issues. It dissects challenges like estimating treatment effects, managing 
user heterogeneity, and considering long-term effects in online environments. This detailed examination provides valuable insights into the nuances of
 A/B testing, making the concepts accessible to a broad audience through the inclusion of illustrative examples.

However, one area for consideration is the ethical dimension surrounding informed consent. Unlike traditional research settings, online experiments can 
sometimes lack transparency regarding user participation. Individuals may not explicitly agree to be part of a study, or the information provided about 
the experiment might be ambiguous. This raises concerns about user awareness and potential manipulation.

The paper's contribution to the field is undeniable. By consolidating existing methodologies and challenges, it sheds light on the intricate nature of A/B
 testing in the online realm. Moreover, it identifies open research areas and gaps in the current literature, paving the way for future explorations and the 
development of novel statistical approaches specifically tailored to OCEs.

Moving forward, valuable next steps would be the development of practical guidelines or frameworks to assist researchers and practitioners in tackling the 
statistical challenges highlighted in the paper. Additionally, overcoming limitations like low power and restrictive methods will be crucial for advancing 
the field and ensuring the robustness of experimental findings in online controlled experiments. It's also important to address the ethical considerations 
surrounding user awareness and informed consent to ensure responsible and transparent practices in online experimentation.
