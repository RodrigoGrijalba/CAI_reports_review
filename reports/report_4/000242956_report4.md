# Report 4 - Statistical Challenges in Online Controlled Experiments: A Review of A/B Testing Methodology (Larsen et. al)

The article discusses the peculiarities of online controlled experiments (OCEs) and some statistical features. It does this in an effort to showcase the rise of OCEs in the tech industry and in the hopes of bridging the gap between academia and online industry by increasing academic's awereness of these reasearch opportunities. 

The main strenght of the article is the well structured introduction to OCEs for someone already familiarized with standard RCTs. It also provides an overview of the literature regarding OCEs, including topics such as controlled experiments utilizing pre-experiment data (CUPED), triggered analysis, and discussions about heterogeneous treatment effects. Finally, the article does very well in including a scenario where SUTVA may not hold in an OCE. This is of special interest to applied researchers who will eventually need to summit their work to journals whose referees will care about these issues.  

One potential weakness could be the lack of greater mathematical results. A section of more formal analysis of OCEs, or some reference to an article regarding that issue, would've added value to the paper. 

All in all, the article advances knowledge by providing an overview of OCEs and relating it to the current RCT literature and practices. One step foward could be the study of OCEs and its methods from a Bayesian framework.
